Scala-simple-game-of-life
=========================

Simple game of life TDD run in scala for demo purposes

this has been coded as closing part of a scala introduction for students.
Each commit is a tdd step. In the description you can see if the code (should be)/is red or green  
and what feature I was working on

Be careful, I have comitted my intellij files as well (there may be absolute paths in there)
to have an easy start for the demo, which I showed at a nearby university.
